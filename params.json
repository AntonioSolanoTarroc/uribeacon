{"name":"UriBeacon","tagline":"The Web Uri Open Beacon","body":"*(pronounced YUR-ee-BEE-kun)*\r\n\r\nCheck out how UriBeacons are used in the [Physical Web](http://google.github.io/physical-web/) project.\r\n\r\nNote: this is a developer preview-release intended for comments and experimentation.\r\n\r\n## Why We Created UriBeacon\r\n\r\nThe UriBeacon Specification is designed with one goal in mind: to\r\ncreate the easiest, most open way to discover and use nearby smart\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nUriBeacon is a wireless advertisement format for broadcasting Uris to\r\nany nearby device. By leveraging the Open Web it enables a\r\n*real*-World Wide Web where every person, place and thing can have its\r\nown Web presence. Our design is:\r\n\r\n1. Compliant with Bluetooth 4.0 Advertising messages.\r\n2. Compatable with iOS and Android low power scanning modes.\r\n3. Independent of any particular hardware, user-agent, service or mobile platform.\r\n4. Openly licensed under Apache 2.0 and as such free of restrictive or proprietary terms.\r\n\r\nIn short, UriBeacon connects low power beacons to the family of Open\r\nWeb technologies and is one step towards making the Internet of Things as\r\neasy to use as the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\n## What is a Uri?\r\n\r\nOne can classify URIs as Locators (URLs), or Names (URNs), or both. A Name functions like a person’s name (or Government ID number), while a Locator resembles that person’s postal address. In other words: URN is an item’s identity, while the URL is a method for finding it.\r\n\r\n* `urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6` [RFC4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\r\n* `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt` [RFC1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt)\r\n\r\nUriBeacons can broadcast familiar HTTP URLs (`http` and `https`) as well as UUID URNs (128-bit universally unique identifiers).\r\n\r\n## UriBeacon Devices and Tags\r\n\r\nVarious things may broadcast UriBeacons. Smart devices such as phones,\r\ntablets, laptops, vending machines, irrigation controllers may\r\nincorporate built in UriBeacons. Other things such as movie posters,\r\nbus stops, and meeting rooms may use small hardware devices, or tags,\r\nspecifically designed to emit a UriBeacon advertisement. The libraries\r\nand sample code in this repository are a resource for developers who\r\nwant to add UriBeacons in existing devices and also to create\r\nstandalone UriBeacon tags.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis is not an official Google product. This is an early-stage experiment that we are developing in the open as we do all things related to the web. This should only be of interest to developers looking to provide feedback and [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-56387145-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
