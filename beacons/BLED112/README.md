**BlueGiga BGScript Reference Implementation**

This URIBeacon implementation uses BGScript from BlueGiga to inplement the full URIBeacon API. It currently supports configuration mode only when the unit is powered up (assuming there is no hardware button on the device)

Even if you are not planning on using BGScript,it is still useful as a sample app to guide your implementation.
